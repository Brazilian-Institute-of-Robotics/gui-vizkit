/*! \mainpage Vizkit: an infrastructure for data display using C++, OpenSceneGraph and Qt, with transparent Ruby bindings

This is the API documentation of vizkit, which offers an infrastructure for 2D
and 3D displays using C++, OpenSceneGraph and Qt. Most of the power of Vizkit is
unleashed in its use in Rock, the Robot Construction Kit
(http://rock-robotics.org), but thanks to its use of standard libraries (OSG and
Qt), the main features are available outside of Rock.

This documents the C++ part of the library.

The Ruby API documentation can be accessed <a href="ruby/index.html">here</a>
